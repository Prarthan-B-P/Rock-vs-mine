# Rock vs Mine Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a given sonar signal is reflected off a rock or a mine using Linear Regression. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of sonar signals, and it classifies the signals as either "Rock" or "Mine" based on the regression output.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains sonar signals represented as numerical features. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a signal, and the target variable indicates whether the signal corresponds to a rock or a mine. 

### Key Characteristics:
- **Features**: Numerical values representing signal attributes.
- **Target Variable**: Binary classification:
  - `0` for Rock
  - `1` for Mine

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib` (optional, for visualizations)

## How It Works
### Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Handle missing values if any.
   - Normalize the features to ensure the model performs optimally.

2. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test).

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train a Linear Regression model using the training set.
   - Use the regression output to classify signals into `Rock` or `Mine`:
     - If the predicted value > 0.5, classify as `Mine`.
     - Else, classify as `Rock`.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-Score

## Running the Project

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Run the Notebook
Open and execute the `rock_vs_mine.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/rock_vs_mine.ipynb
```

Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Example Results
| Signal Features                           | Actual   | Predicted |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| [0.02, 0.15, 0.85, 0.56, 0.34, 0.12, ...] | Rock     | Rock      |
| [0.94, 0.76, 0.89, 0.78, 0.65, 0.84, ...] | Mine     | Mine      |

---

## Limitations
- Linear Regression may not perform optimally for highly complex data.
- Assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable.

---

## Future Work
- Experiment with advanced models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks for better performance.
- Perform feature selection to identify the most important features contributing to predictions.
- Enhance the dataset by adding more diverse and real-world examples.
